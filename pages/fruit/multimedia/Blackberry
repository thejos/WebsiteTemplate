<b>History</b><br />
One of the earliest known instances of <b>blackberry</b> consumption comes from the remains of the Haraldskar Woman, the naturally preserved bog body of a Danish woman dating from approximately 2,500 years ago. Forensic evidence found blackberries in her stomach contents, among other foods. The use of blackberries to make wines and cordials was documented in the London Pharmacopoeia in 1696. As food, blackberries have a long history of use alongside other fruits to make pies, jellies and jams.<br /><br />
<b>Nutrients</b><br />
Cultivated blackberries are notable for their significant contents of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and vitamin K. A 100-gram serving of raw blackberries supplies 180 kilojoules (43 kcal) of food energy and 5 grams of dietary fiber or 25% of the recommended Daily Value (DV). In 100 grams, vitamin C and vitamin K contents are 25% and 19% DV, respectively, while other essential nutrients are low in content.
Blackberries contain both soluble and insoluble fiber components.
Blackberries are also noted for containing manganese and folic acid.
